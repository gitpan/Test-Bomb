=head1 NAME

Test::Bomb - a test which succeeds until a deadline passes ( a time bomb )

=head1 VERSION

version 0.005

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use this test to ignore part of your system until
a deadline passes.  After the deadline the test will
fail unless you replace it.   I use it for large 
projects where I want to forget about some subsystems
until after other parts are done.

usage( in a test script ):

    bomb -after => 'Jan 31 2011';

before Jan 31 prints:

    ok 1 - bomb after Jan 31 2011

after deadline prints

    nok 1 - deadline passed

using bomb groups:

    bomb -with => 'pluginSystem' ;

looks for 'pluginSystem' in the config file and uses the date
assigned there to exire the test.

=head1 NAME

Test::Bomb

=head1 NOTE

this is a development tool.  if you release code that uses this test
I expect you will have some very upset users.

=head1 Global variables

=over

=item @configFiles

this is a list of filenames where the test will look
to find bomb groups.  File format is:

name=date

all whitespace is ignored. everything on the matching line is used
for the test.  Non-matching lines are ignored.

The first file found is used, the first file checked is the environment
variable TESTBOMBCONFIG followed by [.]tbc and [.]testbombconfig in various
places

=item %groups

This variable allow groups to be assigned programatically.
Just assign hash element for the name of the group like this:

$Test::Bomb::group{DateCalculations} = 'Jan 1, 2000'; # RIP Y2K :)

Probably inside some module included by each test script so that they
all get the same date;

=back

=head1 TODO

=over

=item 1

find more ways to check to see if the user is building a release.  if that
is the case then fail.

=back

=head1 EXPORT

bomb is automatically exported; if you don't want to use the function
why did you use the package?

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 bomb -after => 'date to expire'

acts like a test; 
errors cause test failure

=head2 readConfig

look for a group name in a config file

=head2 checkDate dateStr

compare the expiration date with today

=head2 releasing

check for various signs of project release
so we can fail if a release is being generated
( perhaps there should be a way to override this
for testing purposes.. )

NOTE:  any flags added here need to be undone at the
top of the test script; otherwise every test will fail
when distributing this package
